# AI Tutor: Your Personalized Learning Companion ðŸŽ“ðŸ¤–

AI Tutor is an innovative, FHE-powered artificial intelligence agent designed to act as a personal learning tutor. This solution leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** to ensure that student learning materials, notes, and assessment results are kept completely private while providing adaptive learning experiences.

## The Challenge of Personalized Education

In today's educational landscape, students often struggle to receive personalized learning experiences due to privacy concerns and data security issues. Traditional learning systems frequently require access to sensitive personal data to tailor learning plans effectively, which can lead to anxiety and a lack of trust among students. The need for a solution that enhances learning without compromising privacy is more critical than ever.

## How FHE Transforms Learning

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computations to be carried out on encrypted data, giving educators and AI applications the ability to analyze and generate personalized learning plans without ever exposing the underlying sensitive information. This project implements Zama's open-source librariesâ€”such as **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**â€”to ensure that all computations are performed securely, allowing students to learn in an absolutely private and pressure-free environment.

## Core Functionalities of AI Tutor

- **FHE-Encrypted Learning Data**: Students' learning data is encrypted, ensuring that no sensitive information is exposed during the learning process.
- **Personalized Learning Plans**: The AI generates individualized study programs tailored to each student's unique learning style and requirements.
- **Stress-Free Environment**: The AI Tutor creates a non-judgmental space for students to learn, enhancing their educational experience.
- **Adaptive Practice Questions**: Using homomorphic encryption, the system dynamically generates practice questions based on student performance without revealing their weaknesses.
  
## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK**: Core component for confidential computing.
- **Node.js**: For server-side JavaScript execution.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: Development environment for Ethereum-compatible blockchains.
- **React**: For building the user interface.

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AI_Tutor.test.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ hardhat.config.js
```

## Getting Started with AI Tutor

To set up the AI Tutor application on your local machine, make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. **Download the project files**: Obtain the project zip file from your source (do NOT use `git clone`).
2. **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will also fetch the required Zama FHE libraries.

## Build and Run Instructions

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can compile the smart contract, run tests, and start the application as follows:

1. **Compile the smart contract**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
   
2. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Example Use Case

Here is a code snippet demonstrating how to generate a personalized learning plan for a student using the AI Tutor:

```javascript
const AI_Tutor = require('AI_Tutor_Fhe');

// Assume we have the student data in FHE-encrypted format
const encryptedStudentData = ...; // FHE encrypted data

const customizedPlan = AI_Tutor.generateLearningPlan(encryptedStudentData);

console.log('Your Personalized Learning Plan:', customizedPlan);
```

This example highlights how the AI Tutor can work seamlessly with FHE-encrypted data, enhancing the student's learning experience while maintaining their privacy.
